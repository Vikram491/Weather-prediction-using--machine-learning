# Weather Prediction Project

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict weather conditions based on historical data. The prediction model uses various weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure to forecast future weather patterns with improved accuracy.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preprocessing of weather data, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and transformation.
- **Model Selection**: Used machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest for prediction, with hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluated model accuracy using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to ensure robust predictions.
- **Visualization**: Visualized data trends and prediction results using Matplotlib and Seaborn for better insights into the weather patterns.
